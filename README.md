# Y2K38_Problem
Y2K38, or the Year 2038 Problem, is a critical computer bug where systems using 32-bit integers to store time (seconds since Jan 1, 1970) will overflow on January 19, 2038, causing them to "teleport" back to December 1901, potentially breaking everything from smartphones to critical infrastructure like medical devices and financial systems.
